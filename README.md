# Chest-X-Ray-Image-Analysis-for-Pneumonia-Diagnosis
Deep Learning project to classify lung X-ray images as pneumonia or normal using CNN

# Chest X-Ray Image Analysis for Pneumonia Diagnosis

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify lung X-ray images as either pneumonia or normal. The model was trained and tested on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of lung X-ray images and was sourced from Kaggle. You can download the dataset [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets)).
